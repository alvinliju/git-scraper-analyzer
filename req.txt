scrape all the github repo's and give us the data about how the repo is performing is that repo dying or not thats it.

how to do it:
- scrape github 5k req/hr 
- when you get a github repo take it -> 
                    save it as an object with -> 
                            reponame:{link:github-link, likes, maintainers, last-commit-date, number-of-commits}
- save all those info in .json file.
- build a function to determine health of a repo with info we have
